# hello_world
this is my virtual repository for any codes, ideas, resources, and general notes including discussions, screenshots or key highlights.

fellow humans,
help me explore the joy of of writing codes and algorithms. help me have a detailed understanding and broaden my scope of usable languages and systems. Teach me how to build clean and simple-to-understand codes that are sometimes beautiful. above-all-else, communicate, communicate, communicate.
